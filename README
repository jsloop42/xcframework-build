xcframework-build
-----------------

A build script to generate universal xcframework with code signing for iOS and
macOS platforms. Other platforms can be added as required easily.

In order for generating the framework for a platform it should be added under
"Supported Destinations" for the framework target in Xcode.

Set the variables specific to the project before running build.

The bundle will have the following slices.

$ ls Frameworks/framework-name.xcframework/
Info.plist
_CodeSignature
ios-arm64
ios-arm64_x86_64-maccatalyst
ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator
macos-arm64_x86_64
